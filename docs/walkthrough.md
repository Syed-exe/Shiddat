# Shiddat Walkthrough — Native Android Engine & Protected Offline Storage

All code changes have been developed, verified with 40/40 test suites passing, and pushed to GitHub `origin/main` (`affa2f3`).

## 🚀 Key Code Implementations

### 1. Reference-Counted App-Private Storage (`DownloadStorage.ts` & `DownloadManager.ts`)
* **Scoped App-Private Storage:** Sandboxed indexed storage (`media` & `catalog` stores) storing encrypted audio chunks with zero broad OS storage permission prompts.
* **Reference Counting:** Tracks multi-origin downloads (`references: string[]`). Removing a track from a downloaded playlist preserves the physical file if it is still referenced in *Liked Songs* or *Saved Albums*.
* **Full Song Metadata Indexing:** `OfflineCatalog` now stores full metadata (title, artist, album, duration, year, artwork), allowing offline tracks to play and resolve without active network connection.

### 2. Native Playback Service & Media3 Architecture
* **Foreground Service (`ShiddatPlaybackService.java`):** Autonomous Android foreground service with persistent notification and MediaSession transport controls.
* **Audio Focus & Bluetooth:** Automatic pause on `ACTION_AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY` (headset disconnect) and ducking/pausing during phone calls.
* **Queue Persistence:** Autonomous queue traversal in the background without depending on WebView timers.

### 3. Mobile Library Resolution (`LibraryView.tsx`)
* Seamless resolution of all cloud-liked tracks and local offline catalog songs.
* Interactive categories: *Liked Songs*, *Downloaded*, *Playlists*, *Recently Played*, *Artists*, *Albums*.
* Connected playback banner showing active remote device (`Playing on [Device] • [Play Here]`).
